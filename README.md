# javarestapiv1 with react

- Please use Visual Studio Code and Bash Terminal for no problems, but you can use your own favorite editor.

- REACT.js

- open your terminal ->
- cd src/front-end
- npm i
- maybe you will need to use this 'npm i -g create-jqwidgets-react-tsx-app' , but try 'npm start' below first
- npm start
- available on locahost:3000

- Java Spring Boot REST API

- open the terminal and do the following ->
- Make sure you JAVA_HOME path is ok with java jdk 8 also your MAVEN_HOME path is ok too
- mvn install
- mvn compile ( make a class )
- mvn test ( to test it )
- "./mvnw spring boot run" run without the double quotes
- available on localhost:8080


- Notes for BRAVI:
- I did not use webpack, because I ran into some errors.
- My back-end experience is much more NODE.js than JAVA and my front-end is pure JAVASCRIPT
- Months ago that started learning more about React in another REST API Node.js Project with MongoDB.

- Thank you.
